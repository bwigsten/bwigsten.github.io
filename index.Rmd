# Fun Facts
1.) I'm a dog walker in NYC. That's how I can handle not having a dog of my own!

2.) I worked as a zookeeper a few summers ago and loved it, but felt like I could make more of an impact with a career in public health.

3.) My favorite food is sushi.

4.) My favorite show is the Office. 

5.) I ran cross country and track in both high school and college!
