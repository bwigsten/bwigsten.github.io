# Welcome! 

![](images/Blair.png)

My professional information is listed in [here](about.html). 

# Fun Facts
1.) I'm a dog walker here in the city. That's how I can handle not having a dog of my own!

2.) I worked as a zookeeper a few summers ago and loved it, but felt like I could make more of an impact with a career in public health.

3.) My favorite food is a good plate of pasta (penne a la vodka is the best!).

4.) My favorite Netflix binge show is Frasier, and I've seen the entire show through multiple times. 

5.) I ran cross country and track in both high school and college, but didn't keep it up after college ended.
